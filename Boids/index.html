<h2>
    Boids Demo
</h2>


<p>
    A boid refers to a bird like object. There are several approaches that can be taken to achieve a bird like flocking behavoir. Generally boid algorithms start with the same set of rules, which are. 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Boids should follow adjacent boids
    </li>
    <li>
        Boids should avoid adjacent boids
    </li>
    <li>
        Boids should follow the flock
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The great thing about this design is that it supports custom behavoirs easily. For example, if you want the flock to orbit around or move towards a point then you can make a rule that alters each boids velocity to get the desired behavoir. 
    In this demo, each boid has a ray cast in the direction it is currently moving, if that ray collides with any boid then adpats it's velocity with the boid rules. The scripts used are available here.
