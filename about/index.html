<p>My name is Seven Randall.</p>

<p>
    I'm a 2020 university graduate and life long tech enthusiest. 
    I have experience in full-stack and game development with a number of
    frameworks and technologies. I co-founded a weekly competitive programming session 
    at university to spread awareness and inspire students from all backgrounds.

    My passion for programming started young. I would modify the source
    code of video games throughout highschool, which introduced me 
    to 3D graphics and programming fundamentals. During my first year at
    university my interest transitioned into game and graphics development,
    with guidance from articles and tutorials I built a pixel graphics engine 
    which I and fellow students used for university projects and protyping games.
    The performance limitations of pixel graphics encouraged me to learn vector
    graphics with OpenGL, and then game development in Unity. Now I maintain a 
    technical blog, and work on full-stack applications and games to stay active.
