<h1>Who is ThreeFourSeven</h1>
<p>
    Hello, I'm Seven Randall. 

    I'm a 2020 computer science graduate and tech enthusiast. I work on a variety of projects,
    such as OpenGL game engines, machine learning visualizations, and a Unity tycoon game. When im not programming or reading about
    programming I cook, go for walks, and play video games. Currently seeking an entry-level position with a dynamic team.
