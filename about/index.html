<h2>Who is ThreeFourSeven</h2>
<p>
    Hello, I'm Seven Randall. 

    I'm a recent computer science graduate and tech enthusiast. I spend most of my time working on a variety of small projects,
    such as several OpenGL game engines, machine learning visualizations, and a Unity tycoon game. When im not programming or reading about
    programming I cook, go for walks, and play video games.
