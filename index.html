<p>My name is Seven Randall.</p>

<p>
    I'm a life long tech enthusiest that has experience
    in full-stack, game, and graphics development. In May, 2020 I
    graduated from St. Francis Xavier University(STFX) with a 
    Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

    My interest in programming started with modifying the source
    code of video games throughout highschool. During my first year at 
    STFX that interest transitioned into game and graphics development.
    With guidance from articles and tutorials I built a pixel graphics engine 
    which I and fellow students used for full-stack projects and 
    protyping games. The performance limitations encouraged me to learn vector
    graphics with OpenGL, and then game development in Unity. Now I develop full-stack 
    applications, participate in game jams, and maintain a technical blog. I am currently
    living in Halifax, Nova Scotia and am seeking an entry level position as a developer.
